# G2_Hackathon


Problem Statement 3</br>
G2 regularly updates its website with new products by creating new categories and refining existing ones. One crucial aspect of this process is ensuring that each product has a precise description and URL before it is added to the site. We are interested in automating the process of updating product descriptions in our database. We will provide you with a few product URLs, and your output will be a brief 3-4 lines description of each product.
</br>
Proposed Solution:</br>
The proposed solution involves developing a robust system that can automate the process of updating product descriptions on the G2 website. This system will leverage web scraping techniques to extract relevant information from product pages and text summarization algorithms to generate brief descriptions. Additionally, data cleaning and normalization techniques will be employed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the extracted data. The system will adhere to legal and ethical guidelines regarding web scraping and data privacy, and measures will be implemented to optimize scalability and performance.
